# CANSAT-18-TEAM_KALPANA_1
This Repository contains all the code developed during CANSAT'18 compitition by Team Kalpana-1(ID 2426).

## About the CanSat compition
This annual competition is open to teams from universities and colleges. Teams were asked to design and build a space-type system, following the approved competition guide, and then compete against each at the end of two semesters to determine the winners. For more information please head over to:

## Our problem statement
The 2018 mission simulates a space probe (CanSat) entering a planetary atmosphere. The probe shall carry a single large hen's egg. The egg must survive all portions of flight. The operation sequence shall be:

1. The probe is launched to an altitude of 670 meters to 725 meters and then deployed from the rocket. Orientation of deployment is not controlled and is most definitely violent.

2. Once deployed, the probe shall open an aero-braking heat shield. The descent rate shall be kept at 10 to 30 meters/sec. The aero-braking probe must maintain a stable orientation with the heat shield facing the direction of descent during descent. Tumbling is not allowed. Active control surfaces or other non pyrotechnic mechanisms can be used to maintain orientation.

3. At an altitude of 300 meters, the probe shall release the aero-braking heat shield and simultaneously deploy a parachute to reduce the descent rate of 5 meters/sec.

4. The probe shall land leaving the egg intact.

The probe shall include sensors for tracking altitude using air pressure, external temperature, battery voltage and GPS position. A compartment shall be included to hold a large hen's egg. The egg will simulate a delicate instrument.
